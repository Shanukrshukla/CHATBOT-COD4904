Implementation and code explanation

1. Imports:
java
Copy code
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Scanner;
These lines import necessary classes from the Java standard library. Scanner is used to read input from the user, and IOException is used for handling input/output errors.
2. Class Definition:
java
Copy code
public class Chatbot {
This declares a class named Chatbot, which contains the main logic of our chatbot program.
3. Main Method:
java
Copy code
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.println("Chatbot: Hi! How can I assist you today?");
    String userInput;

    do {
        System.out.print("User: ");
        userInput = scanner.nextLine();
        String botResponse = generateResponse(userInput);
        System.out.println("Chatbot: " + botResponse);
    } while (!userInput.equalsIgnoreCase("exit"));

    System.out.println("Chatbot: Goodbye! Have a great day!");
    scanner.close();
}
This method is the entry point of the program. It starts by printing a greeting message.
It then enters a loop that continuously prompts the user for input until the user types "exit".
Inside the loop, it reads user input, generates a response using the generateResponse method, and prints the response.
After the loop exits, it prints a goodbye message and closes the scanner.
4. generateResponse Method:
java
Copy code
public static String generateResponse(String userInput) {
    String response;
    switch (userInput.toLowerCase()) {
        // Cases for different user inputs
    }
    return response;
}
This method takes the user input as a parameter and returns a response based on the input.
It uses a switch statement to handle different cases of user input and generates an appropriate response.
If the user input matches one of the cases, it sets the response variable accordingly.
5. openApplication Method:
java
Copy code
private static void openApplication(String appName) {
    try {
        Runtime.getRuntime().exec(appName);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}
This method takes the name of an application as a parameter and attempts to open it using the Runtime.getRuntime().exec() method.
It is enclosed in a try-catch block to handle any IOException that may occur when executing the command.
If an error occurs, it prints an error message.
6. End of Class:
java
Copy code
}
This marks the end of the Chatbot class

Usage:
Compile the code using a Java compiler.
Run the compiled class file.
Enter commands like "hi", "open notepad", "what is your name", etc., to interact with the chatbot.
Type "exit" to quit the chatbot.

Conclusion:
The Chatbot program provides a simple interaction between the user and the bot. It can respond to basic greetings, queries about its name, and open Notepad upon command. The user can easily interact with the bot by typing commands and receive responses accordingly. The code can be extended to include more functionalities and responses as needed.
